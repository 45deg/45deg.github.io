 *
 * > The range specification of a format 2 table is inclusive: both the minimum and maximum values are included within

 * > rangeMinValue of the other), but ranges should not overlap more than that. In the case of two ranges that touch:
 * >
 * >   - At most one of the ranges should have the nominalValue set to the axis value at which the ranges touch.
 * >   - When the requested axis value is the value at which the ranges touch, the higher range must be used unless the
 * >     nominalValue for the lower range is set to the value at which the ranges touch, and the nominalValue for the
 * >     higher range is greater than that value.
 * >
 * > Similar behavior is used if the value of a format 1 or format 3 table touches the range of a format 2 table:
 * >
 * >   - If the value of a format 1 or format 3 table is equal to the rangeMaxValue of a format 2 table, the format 1 or
 * >     format 3 table is used.
 * >   - If the value of a format 1 or format 3 table is equal to the rangeMinValue of a format 2 table, the format 1 or
 * >     format 3 table is used except if the nominalValue of the format 2 table is also equal to the rangeMinValue.
 * >
 * > If two format 2 tables have ranges for the same axis with non-zero overlap, then the following guidance is
 * > recommended for applications:
 * >
 * >   - If two tables have identical ranges, the application should consistently choose one and ignore the other, by
 * >     its own criteria.
 * >   - Else, if the range of one table is entirely contained within the range of other, then the table with the
 * >     smaller range should be ignored.
 * >   - Else, for axis values within the overlapping range, use the table with the higher range (both rangeMinValue and
